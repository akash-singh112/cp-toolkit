# Competitive Programming Toolkit

A powerful toolkit built for competitive programmers to enhance their workflow and improve problem-solving efficiency during time-constrained programming contests. This website is a comprehensive resource, providing a streamlined and intuitive environment for competitive programming.

## Features:

- **Factorization Tools:** Solve problems related to prime factorization efficiently.
- **GCD/LCM Calculator:** Quickly compute the greatest common divisor and least common multiple for a list of numbers.
- **Graph Visualizer:** Create and visualise graphs with shortest path calculations at your fingertips.
- **MST Generator:** Generate minimum spanning trees for your graph-related queries and understanding of topic for a problem.
- **Runtime Calculator:** Estimate the time complexity of your code so you get an idea of how your code would perform on system tests.
- **Rank Predictor:** Analyze your performance and predict your rank in Codeforces contests (upcoming).
- **Code Snippets Repository:** Access reusable snippets for frequently used algorithms and data structures
  
    1.  DSU
    2.  Binary Exponentiation
    3.  OR Subarray Queries
    4.  Segment Tree Subarray Maximum
    5.  Policy-based Data Structure (PBDS) Set and Multiset (For C++ users)
